This is a [Tapestry](https://www.usetapestry.dev/) boilerplate repository, it's a work in progress - as Tapestry is being developed more features will be added to it. Feel free to clone this repository and use it as a template.

## Getting started

You'll need to add your api key and the tapestry URL to your environment variables - in the file `.env.local`:

```bash
TAPESTRY_API_KEY=xxx
TAPESTRY_URL=https://protocol-server.fly.dev

```

Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install

```

## Start the app

```bash
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
